Notably, Canada underperformed by 14.5%, Poland by 18.1%, and Spain by 14.1%. These substantial gaps underscore the need for a more accurate market analysis and realistic target setting.

Several factors could contribute to these discrepancies, including market volatility, unforeseen economic conditions, and operational challenges. These shortfalls emphasize the necessity for improved strategic planning and execution.
